Databricks Lakeflow End-to-End Declarative Data Pipeline


📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end declarative data pipeline built using Databricks Lakeflow. It follows modern data engineering best practices using a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to process, transform, and serve data for analytics and reporting.

The pipeline leverages Delta Live Tables (DLT) and declarative transformations to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

🧱 Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture:

🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)
- Ingest raw data from source systems (e.g., APIs, CSV, JSON, streaming sources)
- Store data in its original format
- Minimal transformation
- Handles schema evolution

🔹 Silver Layer (Cleaned & Transformed)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Handling missing/null values
- Standardizing formats
- Joining multiple datasets
- Creating enriched datasets

🔹 Gold Layer (Business-Level Aggregations)
- Aggregated and curated data
- Business KPIs and metrics
- Optimized for BI tools and reporting

⚙️ Tech Stack
- Databricks Lakeflow
- Delta Live Tables (DLT)
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Delta Lake
- Python

🚀 Features
- Declarative pipeline design using DLT
- Automated data quality checks (expectations)
- Scalable and incremental data processing
- Stream and batch processing support
- Fault-tolerant and reliable pipeline execution

📂 Project Structure




🔄 Pipeline Flow
- Raw data is ingested into Bronze tables
